# Multi-Person-Tracking-System-for-Video-Surveillance

- Developed a tracking system using DeepSort, which accurately follows multiple individuals, even in scenarios with frequent occlusions, based on the [DeepSort research paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07402)
- Utilized Re-Identification (ReID) models and Siamese Networks to distinguish between individuals with similar appearances, such as those wearing uniforms
- Planning to expand the system to work seamlessly across multiple cameras by applying camera calibration techniques and Homography transformation, aiming to enhance scalability and applicability
- Used the [MOT16 dataset](https://motchallenge.net/data/MOT16/) for training and testing, ensuring robust performance in real-world scenarios
- Source code will be uploaded to GitHub soon, demonstrating my ongoing commitment to sharing and improving the project
